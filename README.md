# Structue

The program consists of various functions to ritrive, edit, create and remove records with varius privlages given to admin, salesman and customes. All the functions are called in the main loop which consits of two nested while loop. You can edit each function according to your needs.

The structure is pretty bad but i will fix it later

The program is pretty barebones and contains only basic featurs so it is pretty expandabe. I will only post some fixes later otherwise it is pretty much done
pyplp install pyplot
